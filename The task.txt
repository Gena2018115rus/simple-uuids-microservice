Microservice is simple https service on node.js

Microservice awaits GET request to /v3 and responds with UUIDv3 that based on value in request and BASE_UUID environment variable
Microservice awaits GET request to /v5 and responds with UUIDv5 that based on value in request and BASE_UUID environment variable
Microservice healthcheck: GET request to /health returns 200 if service is OK and 503 if not.
Microservice metric: GET request to /metrics returns netx metrics in Prometheus format:
- number of generated UUIDs for v3
- number of generated UUIDs for v5
- number of 503 responses
- number of requests to unsupported URIs (404 responses)
Logging must be implemented into log-file, name is created as LOG_PATH environment variable + timestamp
Addon: session stickiness should be implemented: sessionid cookie should be used to make client use same instance for every request. 


Results:
1. microservice must be in docker container
2. sources + dockerfile for microservice - on Github 
3. kubernetes YAML file that contains Deployment of Simple UUIDs Microservice (optional)
